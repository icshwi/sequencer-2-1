Known Problems in Release 2.1.4
-------------------------------

The builtin procedure pvAssign has several bugs:

* In safe mode, if an initially unassigned variable gets assigned
  at runtime using pvAssign, a subsequent pvGet crashes the program.

* When re-assigning a variable that is already connected to a PV, then
  you get warning messages like
  "sevr=minor XYZ connect event but already connected". It also looks as
  if not all resources associated with teh channel are correctly freed.
